Before innovation, before growth, before unity - there must be safety.

Organizations that score high in Cylinder 1:
‚úì Psychological safety to speak up
‚úì Stable systems and processes
‚úì Proactive risk management
‚úì Holistic employee wellbeing

Where fear dominates, trust can't grow.

Trust isn't built on results alone - it's built on fairness.

Enabling Values:
‚Ä¢ Integrity - Doing right when no one watches
‚Ä¢ Fairness - Impartial decisions for all
‚Ä¢ Transparency - Honest information sharing
‚Ä¢ Courage - Standing up under pressure

Organizations strong in Cylinder 5 retain talent 3x longer.

Mizan measures not just IF you have integrity, but HOW it shows up daily.

You can't skip to Cylinder 7 (Transcendence & Unity).

Without Safety (1), there's no foundation.
Without Belonging (2), there's no connection.
Without Integrity (5), there's no trust.

Unity is earned through the journey, not jumped to.

Mizan's 7 Cylinders Framework maps the path from survival to transcendence.
