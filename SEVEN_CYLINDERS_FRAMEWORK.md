# The Seven Cylinders Framework

## Overview

The Seven Cylinders Framework is Mizan's foundational cultural assessment system - a values-based approach to measuring and developing organizational culture across seven progressive dimensions.

Each cylinder represents a level of cultural maturity, from basic survival needs to transcendent unity, with both **enabling values** (that elevate culture) and **limiting values** (that constrain it).

## Cylinder Progression

The framework follows a **progressive maturation model**:

1. **Safety & Survival** → Foundation: Without safety, nothing else matters
2. **Belonging & Loyalty** → Connection: People need to feel they belong
3. **Growth & Achievement** → Excellence: Growth happens in safe, connected environments
4. **Meaning & Contribution** → Purpose: Achievement gains depth through meaning
5. **Integrity & Justice** → Truth: Purpose requires ethical foundation
6. **Wisdom & Compassion** → Balance: Justice paired with mercy creates wisdom
7. **Transcendence & Unity** → Harmony: All cylinders integrated into wholeness

**Key Insight**: Organizations can't skip levels. A company weak in Cylinder 1 (Safety) will struggle with Cylinder 7 (Unity), regardless of efforts.

## Assessment Methodology

### Cylinder Health Score Calculation:

```
Cylinder Score = (Enabling Values Presence × Weight) - (Limiting Values Presence × Weight)

Where:
- Enabling Values Presence: 0-100 (survey, behavioral data, analysis)
- Limiting Values Presence: 0-100 (same sources)
- Weight: Organizational priority (default: equal weight)
```

### Data Sources:
1. **Employee Surveys** - Self-reported alignment
2. **Behavioral Data** - Actions demonstrating values
3. **Performance Data** - Results showing value impact
4. **Feedback Data** - Peer/manager observations
5. **AI Analysis** - Pattern recognition across all data

### Scoring Bands:
- **90-100**: Exceptional - Cylinder fully embodied
- **75-89**: Strong - Cylinder well-developed
- **60-74**: Moderate - Cylinder present but inconsistent
- **40-59**: Weak - Cylinder underdeveloped
- **0-39**: Critical - Limiting values dominate
