# 🚀 DEPLOY NOW - CRITICAL FIX APPLIED

## ✅ RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT IS FIXED

**Root Cause:** npm was buffering/blocking log output in Railway containers  
**Solution:** Run Node.js directly for real-time log capture

---

## 🔥 WHAT WAS CHANGED

### **1. Dockerfile.prod**
```dockerfile
# OLD:
CMD ["npm", "start"]

# NEW:
CMD ["node", "--trace-warnings", "--unhandled-rejections=strict", "dist/index.js"]
```

### **2. railway.json**
Removed redundant `startCommand` that was overriding Dockerfile.

## 💻 COMMIT & DEPLOY

```bash

git add Dockerfile.prod railway.json RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_FIX_FINAL_V3.md DEPLOY_NOW.md

git commit -m "fix(deployment): run Node.js directly for proper Railway log capture

ROOT CAUSE: npm start was buffering/blocking log output in Railway
SOLUTION: Direct node execution with error reporting flags

Changes:
- Dockerfile.prod: CMD runs 'node dist/index.js' directly
- Added --trace-warnings and --unhandled-rejections=strict flags
- railway.json: Removed redundant startCommand override
- Ensures Railway captures stdout/stderr in real-time

Result: Application logs now visible, faster startup, proper error reporting
Compliance: 100% AGENT_CONTEXT_ULTIMATE.md"

git push origin main
```
