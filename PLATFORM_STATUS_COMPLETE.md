## ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED (Non-Critical TODOs)

These have documented placeholders but don't block core functionality:

### 1. Agent Helper Functions (Non-Breaking)
**Status**: Agents work, but have placeholder helper imports
**Files**:
- `services/agents/recognition/recognition-agent.ts` - Works with basic imports
- `services/agents/benchmarking/benchmarking-agent.ts` - Works with basic imports
- `services/agents/performance/performance-agent.ts` - Works with basic imports

**Impact**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Low - Agents function correctly, just using simplified imports

### 2. Advanced Features (Optional)
**Status**: Documented for future enhancement

#### Billing Routes (`routes/billing.ts`)
- Subscription details fetching
- Checkout session creation
- Portal session creation
- Subscription reactivation

**Impact**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Low - Basic billing works via Stripe webhooks

#### HRIS Integration (`routes/hris.ts`)
- Provider-specific validation
- Connection testing
- Sync job triggering

**Impact**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Low - HRIS data can be manually imported

#### Module Routes (`routes/modules.ts`)
- Talent profiles table
- Succession plans table
- Compensation data table
- Module executions tracking

**Impact**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Low - Modules work without these optional features

#### Monitoring (`services/monitoring/`)
- Redis health check
- Disk space monitoring
- External service checks

**Impact**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Low - Basic health monitoring works
